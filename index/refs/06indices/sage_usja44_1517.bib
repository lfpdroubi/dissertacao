    abstract = { Estimating price indexes for different quantiles shows how prices vary for homes that are in different stages of the filtering process. The paper describes a filtering model and its implication for the dynamic interaction of housing prices at these various stages. A time-series analysis of quantile price indexes for three municipalities near Chicago supports the predictions of the filtering model. }
